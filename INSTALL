== INSTALL

= Libray from scratch

Geo::Proj4 uses XS to wrap the PROJ.4 cartographic projections library.
You will need to have at least version 4.4.9 of the PROJ.4 library
installed in order to build and use this module. You can get source
code and binaries for the PROJ.4 library from its home page at
http://www.remotesensing.org/proj/.

= FWTools

An other way to get the library is by installing FWTools, available
at http://fwtools.maptools.org/

In case you have installed FWTools, set environment variable
GEOPROJ_FWTOOLS_DIR to the right location, before running Makefile.PL

   export GEOPROJ_FWTOOLS_DIR=/home/myself/FWTools
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
